Sublime-AutoSetIndentation
==========================

This plugin automatically detects and sets the indentation for you, by default, when a file is loaded.


Why Do I Make This?
===================

Sublime Text detects the indentation when a file is loaded 
if `detect_indentation` is set to `true`, which is the default settings.

However, its detection is wrong sometimes.
You could give following cases a try!

- Files under the [problem_files/](https://github.com/jfcherng/Sublime-AutoSetIndentation/tree/master/problem_files)
- https://github.com/SublimeTextIssues/Core/issues/1459
- https://github.com/SublimeTextIssues/Core/issues/1640

I find that [Indent Finder](http://www.freehackers.org/Indent_Finder) detects 
above files correctly so I make it into this plugin.


Notes
=====

- Abbreviations

  - ST = Sublime Text
  - ASI = AutoSetIndentation (this plugin)

- This plugin respects indentation settings in `.editorconfig` files.
  
- If you don't want to replace ST's `detect_indentation` command with ASI's,
  set the plugin setting `hijack_st_detect_indentation` to `false`.
  
- Even if `hijack_st_detect_indentation` is set to `true` by default, ST will
  still detect the indentation internally before ASI is ready to work.
  After that, ASI will detect the indentation **again**
  hence ST's result will be overridden but the detection is done **twice**.
  You may want to set `detect_indentation` to `false` to skip ST's.
